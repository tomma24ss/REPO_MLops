## 1.1 Set up the lab environment

For this lab assignment, we'll be using the `dockerlab` environment. This environment comes with Docker installed on the VM.

First, we'll need to install the required Ansible roles for provisioning the VM. Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```console
bash ./scripts/role-deps.sh ./dockerlab/ansible/site.yml
```

Then, start the `dockerlab` VM:

```console
cd dockerlab
vagrant up dockerlab
```

## 1.2 Configure Portainer

It's possible to manage Docker containers using the command line, but it's sometimes easier to quickly use a graphical user interface. For this lab assignment, we'll be using [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), a web-based GUI for managing Docker containers.

Navigate to <https://192.168.56.20:9443> to access the Portainer dashboard, ignore the warning about HTTPS and create an admin user. You can use the default settings for the other options.

## 1.3 Create a Docker image for a simple web application

In the folder `/vagrant/webapp` on the VM, you'll find a simple web application. The application is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve a simple API on port 3000 with two endpoints:

- `GET /animals`: returns a list of animals
- `GET /animals/:id`: returns a single animal (with the given `id` if exists)

All animals are generated when the server starts for the first time, so it's very likely that you'll get different animals than your fellow students.

This Node.js application requires some dependencies. These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file and can be installed using the `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` command. Then use the `yarn start` command to start the application.

> :warning: You'll likely not be able to run these commands on your local or virtual machine. You need to run them inside a Docker container, that's what we'll do next.

Add a `Dockerfile` to this folder to create a Docker image for this application. The Docker image should meet the following requirements:

- Start from a Docker image for Node.js version 18.x.x (LTS), you're free to choose an alpine version or not.
- The application should be reachable on port 3000.
- Copy the application code in the `/app` folder in the container.
- Install the application dependencies with the `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` command.
- The application should be started using the `yarn start` command (when the container is started).

Test if your Docker image works by running a container based on your image. You may choose the Docker image name but it might be a good idea to pick `webapp`. You should be able to access the application on port 3000 on both endpoints above. You can use the `curl` command to test this.

## 1.4 Create a Docker Compose file

A `docker run` command can become quite long when you need to specify all the options. Luckily, there's a tool called [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) that allows you to define a multi-container application in a single file. Docker Compose is already installed on the `dockerlab` VM.

> :warning: Docker Compose is now a plugin and should be used as `docker compose` and **not** `docker-compose`.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `/vagrant/webapp` folder to define a service called `webapp`. This services starts the web application image you created in the previous step.

> :bulb: It's a good idea to use the `build` option when your still changing the Docker image. This way, Docker Compose will automatically rebuild the image when you start the container.

Start the API using your Docker Compose file. You should be able to access the application on port 3000 on both endpoints above. You can use the `curl` command to test this. Make sure to start the services in the background.

## 1.5 Backup the database

At this moment, the server uses a [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to store the animals. This is not ideal, because the database is stored inside the container. This means that if the container is removed, the database is also removed. We can solve this by using a volume to store the database on the host system.

Use `docker exec` to get a shell inside the container. If you've used an alpine version of the Node.js image, you'll need to use the `sh` command instead of `bash`.

List the contents of the `/app` folder. You should notice a `database` folder that is not present on your host system. This folder contains the SQLite database file.

Configure the `webapp` service so that the database is stored in a volume on the host system. If all went well, you should be able to see a `database.sqlite` file in the folder `/vagrant/webapp/database` on the VM.

If you restart the container, it should not print the message "Fake data generated" anymore. If this is the case, you know that the database is persisted on the host system.

## 1.6 Add a database service

Now that the database is persisted on the host system, we can add a second service to the Docker Compose file to run a more robust database. We'll use a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for this. The application is configured to automatically connect to a MongoDB database if the environment variable `MONGODB_URL` is set. The application will create the database and the collection if they don't exist yet.

> :exclamation: Before you make any changes, create a copy of the `docker-compose.yml` file and name it `docker-compose-sqlite.yml`.

Extend your existing `docker-compose.yml` file to add a service called `database` that runs a [MongoDB database](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo). Make sure that the application can connect to the database by setting the `MONGODB_URL` environment variable. Notice you can use the service name as hostname in Docker Compose. Use `depends_on` to make sure that the database is started if the application is started. Remember to start the services in the background.

> :bulb: The API prints a message indicating which database is used. If you see the message "MongoDB database initialized", you know that the application is connected to the MongoDB database.
>
> :bulb: There is also an HTTP header `X-Database-Used` in every response that indicates which database is used.

## 1.7 Backup the database

The MongoDB database is now stored inside a Docker container. This again means that if the container is removed, the database is also removed. We can solve this by using a volume to store the database on the host system.

Search through the documentation of the [MongoDB Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) to find out where the data is stored in the container. Create a named volume so that the data is stored in the "docker area" on your virtual machine, and not in the folder `/vagrant/webapp/database` on the VM.

## 1.8 Optimizing the Docker image

You've probably rebuilt the Docker image a couple of times now. If you look at the output of the `docker images` command, you'll see that the application dependencies are installed every time you rebuild the image. This is not ideal, because the dependencies don't change that often. It would be better to install the dependencies once and then reuse the image.

We're going to change the Dockerfile so that the dependencies are installed in a separate layer. Copy the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files to the container and then run the `yarn install` command. Thereafter, copy the application code to the container.

A last optimization is to add a `.dockerignore` file to the folder. This file is similar to the `.gitignore` file and allows you to exclude files from the Docker context (when building an image). Add the `node_modules` folder and all Docker related files to the `.dockerignore` file.

This image is not so difficult and cannot be optimized that much, but it's a best practice to think about the layers you're creating. Try to keep the image as small as possible. You can use the `docker history` command to see the layers of an image. Docker listed a complete list of best practices for writing Dockerfiles: <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/>.

## 1.9 Testing the application

At last, we want to test the application using integration tests written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). The tests are located in the `/vagrant/webapp/test.js` file and can be run using the `yarn test` command.

Add a new service to the Docker Compose file to run the tests. Set the environment variable `API_URL` to the URL of the `webapp` service. Notice that you can use the service name as hostname in Docker Compose. Use the `depends_on` option to make sure that the application is started before the tests are run. Re-use the existing Docker image to run the tests, **only** change the command in the `docker-compose.yml` file and **not** in the `Dockerfile`.

To run the tests, start the webapp and database services in the background. If both are up and running, run the test container. If you try to start the API and run the tests at the same time, the tests will fail because the API and the database are not ready yet.

If you configured everything correctly, you should see three passing tests. If not, read the error message and try to fix the problem.

## 1.10 Pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub

In a real-world scenario, you would push the Docker image to a Docker registry instead of using your local machine as a repository.

A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. You can use a public registry like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or a private registry like [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/), [AWS Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) or [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry).

We're going to push our `webapp` image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Sign up or sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Then create a new repository called `webapp`. Make sure it's a **public** repository. It should get a name in the form of `<your-username>/webapp`.

Now that we have a repository, we can push our image to Docker Hub. But first we need to tag our image. You can tag an image using the `docker tag` command. The command should look like this:

```bash
docker tag webapp <your-username>/webapp
```

Sign in to Docker Hub using the `docker login` command, your username and password. Now push the image to Docker Hub using the `docker push` command:

```bash
docker push <your-username>/webapp
```

To test if your image is successfully pushed to Docker Hub, you can remove all images for the webapp from your local machine and then pull it from Docker Hub. Use `docker image rm` to remove all images for the webapp. Use the `docker images` command to check if all images are removed. You should only have Portainer and MongoDB images left.

If so, copy your current `docker-compose.yml` to `docker-compose-mongo.yml`. Alter the `docker-compose.yml` file so that it uses the image from Docker Hub instead of building the image locally. You should be able to start **and** test the application using the image from Docker Hub. Make sure to first start the webapp and database services in the background and then run the tests.

## Reflection

This setup oversimplifies the real world. In the real world, you would probably use a managed database service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). These services are easier to use, are more robust than a self-hosted database but tend to be expensive. Nevertheless, it's important to know how to run a database in a container. You might need it on your local machine, in a CI/CD pipeline or to reduce costs in a small project.

You would also use a managed CI/CD service like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) or [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to run the tests and deploy the application. But more on that in a later module.

However, the setup hands you some best practices for app deployment:

- Use Docker to package your application and its dependencies.
- Don't expose the database port to the outside world.
- Try to re-use a Dockerfile rather than writing one per environment.
- Think about the layers you're creating when writing a Dockerfile.
- Think about backing up your data (even in local environments).

## Possible extensions

- Alter the API setup so that it waits for the database to be ready before starting the API.
- Alter the test setup so that the container waits for the API to be ready before running the tests.
- Set up a service from the [Awesome selfhosted list](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)

## Cleanup

You can remove the virtual machine using the following command **after demonstrating the result**. Removing the virtual machine before demonstrating the result will result in losing all your work!

```bash
vagrant destroy -f
```

You can also remove the repository you created on Docker Hub.
